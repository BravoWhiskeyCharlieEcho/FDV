# Project Delta

Project Delta is the bot that is currently in development by the Fly Delta Virtual development team. The developers leading the project are Andrew Nasson, and Ethan Ross. The bot is being developed with the DiscordJS library, and the Axios HTTP Client.

## Setting up your Development Environment

Part of the fun of development is getting stuff setup so you can have fun: NOT! I've made the setup procedure for this repo as easy possible. One of the only things you need to do is get your bot token setup. Do to the nature of discord bots, we can't develop with a single bot, and still have a centeralized testing server. What do? Make your own bot! Go [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), and click "Create New App". Name your app, add a profile picture if you'd like, and click "Create App". Scroll down to "Create A Bot User", and "Yes Do It". Under the "Bot" tab, click the "click to reveal", and copy your bot token, you've already completed the hardest part. Make sure you have the repository to your local machine, and find the bot-token-sample.json file. Change the name to bot-token.json, and copy your bot token to "token goes here". Do **NOT** share your bot token with anyone. Congratulations, you're ready to go.
